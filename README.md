Task 2

Create a python program named “task2”, and use the built-in function `print` in it several times. Try to pass “sep”, “end” params and pass several parameters separated by commas. 

Also, provide a comment text above each print statement, mentioned above, with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.

(Ex.
# 'hello world'
print('hello world')
)
 

Task 3

Write a program, which has two print statements to print the following text (capital letters "O" and "H", made from "#" symbols):

#########
#       #
#       #
#       #
#########


#       #
#       #
######### 
#       # 
#       #
 
Pay attention that usage of spaces is forbidden, as well as creating the whole result text string using """ """, use \n and \t symbols instead.

Task 1

The greeting program.

Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored as separate variables and then prints a message like this:  

"Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some python."
Note that <name> and <day> are predefined variables in source code.

An additional bonus will be to use different string formatting methods for constructing result string.

 

Task 2

Manipulate strings.

Save your first and last name as separate variables, then use string concatenation to add them together with a white space in between and print a greeting.

 

Task 3

Using python as a calculator.

Make a program with 2 numbers saved in separate variables a and b, then print the result for each of the following: 

Addition
Subtraction
Division
Multiplication
Exponent (Power)
Modulus
Floor division
